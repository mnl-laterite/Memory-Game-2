## Memory Game 2
A memory game app. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the pieces from the table. Pieces are eliminated in pairs, if they are both uncovered during the same turn. A turn consists of flipping over two game pieces. The two pieces are flipped back bottom-side-up if they don't match.
